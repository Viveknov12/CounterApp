# CounterApp
This counter app is built with simple React with Tailwind CSS for styling. This app, as the name implies, allows you to count. This project contains only three handlers: incrementHandler, decrementHandler, and resetHandler, each of which performs the operation specified by its name.
I learned about a react hook (useState) in this app, and this is my first hands-on project with react.
